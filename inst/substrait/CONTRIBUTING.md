# Contributing to Substrait

Welcome!

## Dependencies

There's no formal set of dependencies for Substrait, but here are some that are useful to have:

* [`buf`](https://docs.buf.build/installation) for easy generation of proto serialization/deserialization code
* [`protoc`](https://grpc.io/docs/protoc-installation/), used by `buf` and usable independent of `buf`
* A Python environment with [the website's `requirements.txt`](https://github.com/substrait-io/substrait/blob/main/site/requirements.txt) dependencies installed if you want to see changes to the website locally
